## Questions & Answers

### 1. Rate Limiting

**Q: What is rate limiting?**

**A:** Rate limiting is a strategy used to control the amount of requests that can be made to a system within a specified time period. In the context of Agent C, rate limiting prevents overloading the system by restricting how many calls or operations a user can perform in succession. This helps ensure fair usage of resources, prevents abuse, and maintains system stability and performance.

When a user exceeds their allocated rate limit, they may receive an error message or be required to wait before making additional requests. Rate limits are typically expressed as a number of allowed requests per time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
