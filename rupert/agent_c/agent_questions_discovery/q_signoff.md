# Question: What can I actually expect when utilizing requires_completion_signoff?

## Critical Finding: ALL Patterns Are Metadata-Only

**NONE of these values trigger system enforcement.** They're ALL workflow convention patterns.

### Source Code Reality:
```python
requires_completion_signoff: Optional[str] = Field(
    default="true", 
    description="Whether task requires signoff. May be one of 'true', 'false' of 'human_required'"
)
```

The system just stores the value - no validation, no blocking, no enforcement.

## The Three Patterns (Semantic Convention, Not Code Enforcement)

### `requires_completion_signoff: "true"` (default)
**Semantic Intent**: "This task needs validation before considered complete"
- **NOT enforced by system**
- **Who validates**: Prime agent or orchestrator (another AGENT)
- **Workflow**: Clone completes → Prime agent reviews → Prime signs off with `completion_signoff_by`
- **Use when**: Want agent-to-agent validation before moving on

### `requires_completion_signoff: "false"`
**Semantic Intent**: "Can be auto-completed without validation"
- **NOT enforced by system**
- **Who validates**: Nobody (auto-complete)
- **Workflow**: Clone completes → Sets completed=true → No signoff needed
- **Use when**: Simple, routine tasks where validation doesn't add value

### `requires_completion_signoff: "human_required"`
**Semantic Intent**: "Needs HUMAN validation, not just agent"
- **NOT enforced by system**
- **Who validates**: Human stakeholder (YOU)
- **Workflow**: Clone completes → Agent marks ready → HUMAN reviews → Human/agent sets `completion_signoff_by: "Master Ethan"`
- **Use when**: Critical quality gates, compliance checkpoints, important decisions

## The Practical Difference

| Pattern | Who Signs Off | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `"true"` | Any agent (prime/orchestrator) | Standard validation gates |
| `"false"` | Nobody (auto-complete) | Routine tasks |
| `"human_required"` | Human stakeholder | Critical quality gates |

## What Does NOT Happen (For Any Pattern)

- ❌ System does NOT block agent from marking complete
- ❌ System does NOT notify anyone that review is needed
- ❌ System does NOT prompt for approval
- ❌ System does NOT enforce signoff requirement

## Workflow Patterns That Make It Work

**Pattern 1: Agent Self-Discipline**
- Agent persona instructs them to check `requires_completion_signoff` value
- Agent STOPS and notifies appropriate party before marking complete
- Relies on agent following instructions

**Pattern 2: User-Driven Review**
- You check planning tool for tasks requiring signoff
- You review completion reports
- You manually approve or request revisions

**Pattern 3: Orchestrator Validation**
- Orchestrator checks signoff status before proceeding
- Notifies appropriate party if signoff missing
- Relies on orchestrator workflow discipline

## Example Workflow (Human Required)

1. Agent creates task with `requires_completion_signoff: "human_required"`
2. Agent completes work, writes `completion_report`
3. **Agent STOPS and notifies you**: "This requires your review"
4. You review the deliverable
5. You approve or request changes
6. Agent marks complete with `completion_signoff_by: "your_name"`

## Bottom Line

**ALL THREE PATTERNS HAVE IDENTICAL ENFORCEMENT**: None. Zero. Nada.

**The difference is SEMANTIC CONVENTION** for multi-agent workflow patterns.

This feature is:
- ✅ Workflow convention metadata
- ✅ Semantic intent signaling
- ✅ Coordination pattern enabler
- ✅ Audit trail documentation

This feature is NOT:
- ❌ System-enforced blocking
- ❌ Automated notification
- ❌ Technical validation gate
- ❌ Mandatory review system

**Key Insight:** It's metadata that tells agents "this is the intended workflow pattern" - but enforcement must be built into agent personas, not relied upon from the system.

## HOW TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A QUALITY GATE STOP

If you want an agent to **actually stop and wait** for human approval, you must explicitly build this behavior into the agent's persona.

### Required Persona Instructions

```markdown
## Quality Gate Protocol
When completing tasks:
1. Check the task's `requires_completion_signoff` value
2. If `"human_required"`:
   - Complete the work and write `completion_report`
   - **STOP and notify Master Ethan** that review is required
   - **WAIT for explicit approval** before marking task complete
   - Only mark complete after approval with `completion_signoff_by: "admin"`
3. If `"true"`: Follow standard validation workflow (prime/orchestrator approval)
4. If `"false"`: Mark complete immediately
```

### How Approval Must Be Given/Received

**Agent Behavior:**
1. Agent completes work
2. Agent writes `completion_report` with deliverable details
3. Agent notifies you: "Task [name] requires your review. Please review [deliverable location] and approve."
4. **Agent STOPS** - does NOT mark task complete
5. **Agent WAITS** for your explicit response

**Your Response:**
- **To Approve**: "Approved, you can mark it complete" or "Looks good, proceed"
- **To Request Changes**: "Please revise [specific feedback]"

**Agent Completion:**
- Only after your approval, agent calls:
  ```
  wsp_update_task(
      task_id="...",
      completed=True,
      completion_signoff_by="admin"  # Your username
  )
  ```

### Critical Requirements for This to Work

✅ **Persona must explicitly instruct** agent to stop and wait
✅ **Agent must follow instructions** (depends on agent discipline)
✅ **You must actually review** and provide approval
✅ **Clear communication protocol** for approval/revision requests

❌ **System will NOT enforce** the stop - it's all agent behavior
❌ **Without persona instructions** - agent ignores field and continues
❌ **No automatic notifications** - agent must explicitly notify you

## AGENT-TO-AGENT VERIFICATION GATE

Use `requires_completion_signoff: "true"` for agent verification (not "human_required").

### Required Setup:

**Completing Agent Persona:**
```markdown
## Quality Gate Protocol
When task has `requires_completion_signoff: "true"`:
1. Complete work and write `completion_report`
2. **STOP and notify verifier agent** by name
3. **WAIT for verifier's approval** before proceeding
```

**Verifier Agent Persona:**
```markdown
## Verification Protocol
When notified of work requiring verification:
1. Review deliverable against specified criteria
2. If approved: Call `wsp_update_task(completed=True, completion_signoff_by="verifier_agent_name")`
3. If needs revision: Provide feedback and request changes
```

### Workflow:
1. Clone completes → notifies Verifier
2. Verifier reviews → approves or requests revisions  
3. Verifier signs off with their agent name
4. Orchestrator proceeds only after verification

### Requirements:
✅ Both agents need explicit persona instructions for their roles
✅ Verification standards must be explicit in verifier's persona
✅ Orchestrator must coordinate the handoff

❌ Still no system enforcement - relies on agent behavior
