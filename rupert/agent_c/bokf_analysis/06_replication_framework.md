# BOKF Process Replication Framework

## Core Patterns to Extract and Reuse

### Pattern 1: Sequential Multi-Domain Processing

**BOKF Implementation**:
- 11 business domains processed sequentially by Dominic
- ONE domain at a time (never parallel)
- Progressive cross-domain insight aggregation
- Context compression between domains

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Identify Domain Structure**:
```
Step 1: Analyze client system for natural domain boundaries
  - Business capability areas (e.g., billing, customer service, reporting)
  - Technical subsystems (e.g., authentication, data access, workflow)
  - Organizational divisions (e.g., departments, product lines)

Step 2: Define domain processing sequence
  - Start with foundational/core domains
  - Progress to dependent/specialized domains
  - Consider business value and risk

Step 3: Create domain specialist agent
  - Similar to Dominic configuration
  - Sequential processing discipline
  - Cross-domain integration analysis
  - Context compression capabilities
```

**Adaptation Questions**:
- How many domains does the client system have?
- What are the dependencies between domains?
- Which domains are highest business value/risk?
- What's the optimal processing sequence?

**Example Application - Healthcare System**:
```
Domain Sequence:
1. Patient Management (foundational)
2. Clinical Documentation (core clinical)
3. Order Management (clinical workflows)
4. Lab Integration (external interface)
5. Pharmacy Management (specialized clinical)
6. Billing & Claims (financial)
7. Insurance Verification (financial integration)
8. Scheduling & Appointments (operational)
9. Reporting & Analytics (cross-cutting)
10. Compliance & Audit (cross-cutting)
```

### Pattern 2: Step-by-Step Technical Analysis with Clone Delegation

**BOKF Implementation**:
- Tina processes technical analysis in 21 discrete steps
- Each step: 30-60 minutes with multi-clone decomposition (15-30 min clones)
- Three categories: Analysis, Synthesis, Validation
- Progressive context compression

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Define Technical Analysis Phases**:
```
Phase 1: Legacy Assessment
  - Architecture analysis (3-5 steps)
  - Technical debt inventory (4-6 steps)
  - Technology stack evaluation (2-4 steps)

Phase 2: Modernization Planning
  - Opportunity identification (5-8 steps)
  - Technology selection (3-5 steps)
  - Migration strategy (4-6 steps)

Phase 3: Validation & Readiness
  - Feasibility validation (3-5 steps)
  - Risk assessment (2-4 steps)
  - Stakeholder alignment (2-3 steps)
```

**Clone Task Sizing Guidelines**:
```
Optimal Clone Task:
✅ 15-30 minute duration
✅ Single focused deliverable
✅ 1-3 input sources
✅ Clear output format
✅ Measurable completion

Red Flags:
❌ Multiple deliverables
❌ >30 minute duration
❌ >5 input sources
❌ Vague objectives
```

**Example Application - Legacy ERP Modernization**:
```
Technical Analysis Steps:
1. Inventory monolithic architecture components (25 min, 3 clones)
2. Identify data access anti-patterns (20 min, 2 clones)
3. Map business logic to bounded contexts (30 min, 4 clones)
4. Assess integration interfaces (25 min, 3 clones)
5. Evaluate database schema modernization (30 min, 3 clones)
... (continue for 15-25 total steps)
```

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Orchestration Architecture

**BOKF Implementation**:
- Sequential Orchestration Engine (Douglas Design Engine)
- Direct Communication Mesh (Douglas Main)
- Sub-Orchestrators (Dominic, Tina)
- Quality Gates at phase transitions

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Determine Orchestration Needs**:
```
Use Sequential Engine when:
- Multiple distinct phases with dependencies
- Long-running workflows (weeks/months)
- Complex state management requirements
- Quality gates between phases

Use Direct Mesh when:
- Collaborative specialist work
- Frequent peer-to-peer communication
- Rapid iteration requirements
- Lower coordination overhead acceptable

Use Hybrid (both) when:
- Both patterns needed simultaneously
- Phase-based work + specialist collaboration
- Complex workflows + high-touch coordination
```

**Design Orchestration Hierarchy**:
```
Level 1: Primary Orchestrator
  - Workflow state management
  - Phase coordination
  - Quality gate execution
  - Overall progress tracking

Level 2: Sub-Orchestrators (if needed)
  - Specialized processing (domain analysis, technical analysis)
  - Step-by-step execution coordination
  - Clone delegation management
  - Phase-specific state management

Level 3: Specialists
  - Focused expertise (requirements, architecture, implementation, testing)
  - Peer-to-peer collaboration
  - Deliverable creation
  - Quality validation
```

**Example Application - Financial System Migration**:
```
Primary Orchestrator (Migration Conductor):
├── Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
│   └── Sub-Orchestrator: Legacy Analysis Coordinator
│       ├── Domain Analyst (accounts, transactions, reporting)
│       └── Technical Analyst (architecture, data, integration)
├── Phase 2: Architecture & Design
│   └── Direct Mesh: Architecture Team
│       ├── Solution Architect
│       ├── Data Architect
│       ├── Integration Architect
│       └── Security Architect
└── Phase 3: Implementation & Validation
    └── Direct Mesh: Development Team
        ├── Implementation Lead
        ├── Test Engineer
        ├── DevOps Engineer
        └── Quality Assurance
```

### Pattern 4: Context Management for Long Workflows

**BOKF Implementation**:
- Multi-level compression (step, phase, workflow)
- Progressive summarization between phases
- Metadata-based state persistence
- Resume-from-checkpoint capability

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Assess Context Requirements**:
```
Workflow Duration:
- <1 week: Minimal context management
- 1-4 weeks: Phase-level compression
- 1-3 months: Multi-level compression with checkpoints
- >3 months: Aggressive compression + persistent state

Complexity Indicators:
- Number of phases/steps
- Number of coordinating agents
- Volume of analysis data
- Frequency of handoffs
```

**Design Compression Strategy**:
```
Level 1: Real-time Compression
  - After each significant step
  - Extract key insights only
  - 10:1 compression ratio minimum

Level 2: Phase Compression
  - At phase transitions
  - Comprehensive summary of phase
  - 20:1 compression ratio minimum

Level 3: Workflow Compression
  - For recovery and reporting
  - Executive summary of entire workflow
  - 50:1 compression ratio minimum
```

**Example Application - Enterprise Cloud Migration**:
```
Context Management Strategy:
├── Discovery Phase (4 weeks)
│   ├── Weekly compression: 100 pages → 5-page summary
│   └── Phase end: 500 pages → 10-page executive summary
├── Planning Phase (3 weeks)
│   ├── Weekly compression: 80 pages → 4-page summary
│   └── Phase end: 300 pages → 8-page executive summary
└── Execution Phase (12 weeks)
    ├── Weekly compression: 150 pages → 7-page summary
    └── Phase end: 1800 pages → 15-page executive summary

Workflow-level: 2600 pages → 20-page comprehensive summary
```

### Pattern 5: Quality Gate Framework

**BOKF Implementation**:
- Gates at each phase transition
- Validation criteria with acceptance thresholds
- Rollback triggers and escalation protocols
- PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL decisions

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Define Quality Gates**:
```
For each phase transition:
1. Define validation criteria (what to check)
2. Set acceptance thresholds (how good is good enough)
3. Establish rollback triggers (when to stop)
4. Create escalation protocols (who to involve)
```

**Quality Gate Template**:
```yaml
gate_id: "phase_X_to_phase_Y"
gate_name: "Descriptive name"

validation_criteria:
  - criterion_1: "Measurable requirement"
    acceptance_threshold: "95% or higher"
    measurement_method: "How to measure"
  
  - criterion_2: "Measurable requirement"
    acceptance_threshold: "90% or higher"
    measurement_method: "How to measure"

rollback_triggers:
  - "Criterion 1 below 80%"
  - "Criterion 2 below 70%"
  - "Any critical defects identified"

escalation_protocol:
  - condition: "Criterion 1 below 85%"
    escalate_to: "Technical Lead"
  - condition: "Multiple criteria failing"
    escalate_to: "Program Manager"

decision_framework:
  pass: "All criteria meet thresholds"
  conditional_pass: "Most criteria met, minor issues, proceed with monitoring"
  fail: "Critical criteria failed, rollback required"
```

**Example Application - Data Warehouse Modernization**:
```
Quality Gates:
1. Source Analysis → Data Model Design
   - 100% source system documentation complete
   - 95% data lineage traced
   - 90% business rule extraction complete
   
2. Data Model Design → ETL Development
   - 100% target schema validated
   - 95% transformation logic documented
   - 90% data quality rules defined
   
3. ETL Development → Testing
   - 100% ETL code complete
   - 95% unit test coverage
   - 90% error handling implemented
```

### Pattern 6: Workspace Safeguarding Strategy

**BOKF Implementation**:
- Original source: `bokf_source` (READ-ONLY)
- Modernization work: `bokf_design` (READ/WRITE)
- Complete isolation between old and new
- Metadata-based analysis storage

**Replication for Future Clients**:

**Design Workspace Architecture**:
```
[client]_source (READ-ONLY):
  - Original client codebase
  - Never modified
  - Reference only

[client]_design (READ/WRITE):
  - All modernization work
  - New code development
  - Analysis artifacts

[client]_schema (READ-ONLY):
  - Database structures
  - Data models
  - Reference data

[client]_output (READ-ONLY):
  - Finalized deliverables
  - Requirements documents
  - Analysis reports
```

**Access Control Matrix**:
```
Agent Type | Source | Design | Schema | Output
-----------|--------|--------|--------|-------
Orchestrator | READ | R/W | READ | READ
Specialist | READ | R/W | READ | READ
Domain Analyst | READ | READ | READ | READ
Technical Analyst | READ | READ | READ | READ
```

**Example Application - Banking System Modernization**:
```
acme_bank_source:
  - Legacy COBOL code
  - Mainframe JCL
  - VSAM file definitions

acme_bank_design:
  - New Java/Spring code
  - Microservice implementations
  - CI/CD configurations

acme_bank_schema:
  - DB2 database schemas
  - Data dictionaries
  - ER diagrams

acme_bank_output:

## Success Factors for Replication

### Critical Success Factors

**1. Proper Domain Identification**:
- Don't artificially split or combine domains
- Use business capability mapping
- Validate with client stakeholders

**2. Realistic Task Sizing**:
- 15-30 minute clone tasks (no larger)
- 30-60 minute agent steps
- Break large analysis into multiple steps

**3. Context Management Discipline**:
- Compress aggressively at every opportunity
- Use metadata for state, not repeated file reading
- Design for recovery from day one

**4. Quality Gate Rigor**:
- Define measurable criteria upfront
- Don't skip gates to save time
- Document gate decisions and rationale

**5. Workspace Safeguarding**:
- Separate read-only source from read/write work
- Never mix old and new code
- Use metadata for analysis artifacts

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Parallel Processing Too Early**:
- ❌ Don't process multiple domains in parallel
- ✅ Master sequential processing first
- ✅ Add parallelism only when proven necessary

**Pitfall 2: Clone Task Overload**:
- ❌ Don't create 60-minute clone tasks
- ✅ Break into 2-3 smaller tasks
- ✅ Use multi-clone coordination

**Pitfall 3: Skipping Context Compression**:
- ❌ Don't carry full context through long workflows
- ✅ Compress at every step
- ✅ Monitor token usage proactively

**Pitfall 4: Weak Quality Gates**:
- ❌ Don't use subjective criteria
- ✅ Define measurable thresholds
- ✅ Enforce rollback when gates fail

**Pitfall 5: Inadequate Recovery Planning**:
- ❌ Don't assume workflows complete without interruption
