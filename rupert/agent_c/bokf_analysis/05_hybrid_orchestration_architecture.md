# BOKF Hybrid Orchestration Architecture

## Architecture Overview

**Hybrid Pattern**: Combines Sequential Orchestration Engine with Direct Communication Mesh

**Core Components**:
- Sequential Orchestration Engine (Phase control)
- Direct Communication Mesh (Specialist collaboration)
- Sub-Orchestrator Coordination (Dominic, Tina)
- Quality Gate Framework (Phase transitions)
- Context Management System (Long workflow support)

---

## Component 1: Sequential Orchestration Engine

**Primary Agent**: Douglas (Design Orchestration Engine) - `bokf_design_orchestrator`

### Responsibilities

**Workflow State Machine Management**:
- Manages 7-phase sequential process
- Enforces phase boundaries and dependencies
- Controls phase transitions through quality gates
- Tracks overall workflow progress

**Phase Coordination**:
```
Phase 1: Workflow Initialization
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 2: Domain Analysis (Dominic coordination)
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 3: Domain Quality Gate
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 4: Technical Analysis (Tina coordination)
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 5: Technical Quality Gate
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 6: Consolidation Management (Tina coordination)
  ↓ (Quality Gate)
Phase 7: Final Integration
```

**State Persistence**:
```
//bokf_design/meta/orchestration_workflow/
├── workflow_state/
│   ├── current_phase: 1-7
│   ├── phase_status: in_progress|completed|failed
│   └── overall_progress_percentage: number
├── phase_tracking/
│   └── [phase_id]/
│       ├── status: not_started|in_progress|completed
│       ├── completion_time: timestamp
│       └── outputs_location: path
└── agent_coordination/
    ├── dominic_integration/
    └── tina_integration/
```

### Key Patterns

**ONE PHASE AT A TIME**:
- No parallel phase execution
- Complete current phase before starting next
- Clear handoff protocols between phases
- Quality gate validation before progression

**AGENT TEAM COORDINATION**:
- Uses AgentTeamTools for sub-orchestrator assignment
- Structured handoff with context packages
- Real-time progress monitoring via metadata
- Completion signaling and validation

## Component 2: Direct Communication Mesh

**Primary Agent**: Douglas (Main Orchestrator) - `douglas_bokf_orchestrator`

### Responsibilities

**Specialist Coordination**:
- Coordinates Rex (Requirements), Aria (Architecture), Mason (Implementation), Vera (Testing)
- Enables peer-to-peer specialist communication
- Maintains orchestrator oversight without bottlenecking
- Eliminates "telephone game" effects

**Communication Pattern**:
```
        Douglas (Orchestrator)
              |
    +----+----+----+----+
    |    |    |    |    |
   Rex Aria Mason Vera
    |    |    |    |
    +----+----+----+
         (Direct peer communication)
```

### Key Patterns

**DIRECT SPECIALIST COLLABORATION**:
- Rex can communicate directly with Aria about requirements
- Aria can communicate directly with Mason about architecture
- Mason can communicate directly with Vera about testing
- Douglas monitors but doesn't relay every message

**ORCHESTRATOR OVERSIGHT**:
- Douglas maintains strategic direction
- Douglas validates deliverables at quality gates
- Douglas coordinates phase transitions
- Douglas manages competitive strategy

**3-PHASE SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOW**:
```
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
  Douglas → Rex → Douglas (→ Shawn Wallace signoff for Gatekeeper)

Phase 2: Architecture Design
  Douglas → Aria → Douglas (→ Shawn Wallace signoff for Gatekeeper)

Phase 3: Implementation & Testing
  Douglas → Mason → Vera → Douglas (→ Shawn Wallace signoff for Gatekeeper)
```

## Component 3: Sub-Orchestrator Coordination

### Sub-Orchestrator 1: Dominic (Domain Analysis)

**Role**: Processes 11 domains sequentially under Douglas coordination

**Coordination Protocol**:
```
Douglas (Design Engine) → Dominic (Domain Assignment)
  ↓
Dominic processes single domain:
  - Requirements extraction
  - Capability synthesis
  - Cross-domain analysis
  - Business value assessment
  - Stakeholder materials
  ↓
Dominic → Douglas (Completion Signal)
  ↓
Douglas validates → Assigns next domain
  ↓
Repeat for all 11 domains
```

**Communication Channels**:
- **Assignment Reception**: AgentTeamTools communication
- **Progress Reporting**: Metadata updates in orchestrator interface
- **Completion Signaling**: Status update in orchestrator metadata
- **Context Handoff**: Compressed context packages in metadata

**Sequential Processing Rule**:
- ONE domain at a time (never parallel)
- Complete domain before next assignment
- Progressive cross-domain insights
- Context compression between domains

### Sub-Orchestrator 2: Tina (Technical Analysis & Consolidation)

**Role**: Executes step-by-step technical analysis and consolidation under Douglas coordination

**Coordination Protocol**:
```
Douglas (Design Engine) → Tina (Phase Assignment)
  ↓
Tina executes phase in steps:
  - Technical debt analysis (21 steps)
  - OR Consolidation management (27 steps)
  - Step-by-step with clone delegation
  - Quality validation per step
  ↓
Tina → Douglas (Phase Completion)
  ↓
Douglas validates → Assigns next phase or completes workflow
```

**Communication Channels**:
- **Phase Assignment**: AgentTeamTools communication
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time metadata updates
- **Step Completion**: Per-step status in metadata
- **Context Compression**: Progressive summarization in metadata

**Step-by-Step Execution Rule**:
- One step per interaction
- Clone delegation for analysis work
- Verification before step completion
- Context compression between steps

---

## Component 4: Quality Gate Framework

### Quality Gate Architecture

**Gate Locations**:
- Phase 1 → Phase 2: Workflow initialization validation
- Phase 2 → Phase 3: Domain analysis completion validation
- Phase 3 → Phase 4: Domain quality validation
- Phase 4 → Phase 5: Technical analysis completion validation
- Phase 5 → Phase 6: Technical quality validation
- Phase 6 → Phase 7: Consolidation completion validation
- Phase 7 → Delivery: Final integration validation

**Gate Structure**:
```
Quality Gate:
├── Validation Criteria: [measurable requirements]
├── Acceptance Thresholds: [minimum quality scores]
├── Rollback Triggers: [failure conditions]
└── Escalation Protocols: [when to escalate]
```

### Gate Execution Protocol

**For Each Gate**:
1. **Prepare**: Gather deliverables and validation criteria
2. **Execute**: Run comprehensive validation
3. **Decide**: PASS | CONDITIONAL PASS | FAIL
4. **Document**: Record results and rationale
5. **Act**: Proceed | Monitor | Rollback

**Example Gate (Phase 2 → Phase 3)**:
```
Validation Criteria:
- 100% domain analysis completion
- 95%+ cross-domain integration opportunity identification
- 90%+ business value assessment completeness
- 95%+ stakeholder validation material readiness

Decision:
- PASS: All criteria met, proceed to Phase 3
- CONDITIONAL: Minor issues, proceed with monitoring
- FAIL: Critical issues, rollback to domain re-analysis
```

### Authority Integration (Gatekeeper)

**Shawn Wallace Signoff Protocol**:
- Mandatory signoff at phase boundaries
- Approval batching to prevent overwhelm
- Priority classification (CRITICAL | HIGH | ROUTINE)
- Complete documentation package before signoff request

---

## Component 5: Context Management System

### Context Compression Strategy

**Multi-Level Compression**:

**Level 1: Step-Level** (After each step):
```
Extract:
- Key technical insights
- Critical business findings
- Important decisions made
- Dependencies for next steps

Compress:
- Detailed analysis → Actionable insights
- 100 pages → 5 key points
```

**Level 2: Phase-Level** (At phase transitions):
```
Extract:
- Phase outcomes and deliverables
- Critical decisions and rationale
- Cross-phase dependencies
- Quality metrics and validation

Compress:
- Multiple steps → Strategic insights
- Detailed outputs → Executive summary
```

**Level 3: Workflow-Level** (For recovery and reporting):
```
Extract:
- Workflow progress and status
- Major decisions and business value
- Technical architecture coherence
- Implementation readiness

Compress:
- Entire workflow → One-page summary
- Multi-phase analysis → Key recommendations
```

### Context Handoff Protocol

**Between Agents**:
```
Source Agent (e.g., Dominic) prepares handoff:
├── Execution summary (what was done)
├── Key insights (what was learned)
├── Critical decisions (what was decided)
├── Dependencies (what's needed next)
└── Context package (compressed for consumption)
  ↓
Target Agent (e.g., Douglas) receives handoff:
├── Validates context completeness
├── Reconstructs work context
├── Prepares for next phase
└── Assigns next work package
```

**Context Storage**:
```
//bokf_design/meta/orchestration_workflow/context_management/
├── phase_context_packages/
│   ├── domain_analysis_context: compressed insights
│   ├── technical_analysis_context: compressed insights
│   └── consolidation_context: compressed insights
└── context_compression/
    ├── compressed_domain_insights: summary data
    ├── compressed_technical_analysis: summary data
    └── critical_decisions_log: decision trail
```

---

## Component 6: Recovery and Resilience System

### Multi-Level Recovery Capabilities

**Level 1: Checkpoint-Based Recovery**:
```
Restore from last successful checkpoint:
- Phase completion checkpoint
- Quality gate checkpoint
- Major milestone checkpoint
```

**Level 2: Phase-Based Recovery**:
```
Restore to beginning of current phase:
- Reload phase context
- Reinitialize agent coordination
- Restart phase execution
```

**Level 3: Domain/Step-Based Recovery**:
```
Restore to last completed unit:
- Domain-based for Dominic
- Step-based for Tina
- Preserve completed work
```

**Level 4: Full Workflow Recovery**:
```
Complete workflow restart:
- Preserve all deliverables
- Reinitialize orchestration
- Resume with lessons learned
```

### Failure Detection and Response

**Automated Detection**:
```
//bokf_design/meta/orchestration_workflow/recovery_system/
├── health_monitoring/
│   ├── workflow_heartbeat: timestamp tracking
│   ├── phase_monitoring: progress rate tracking
│   ├── agent_coordination_monitoring: communication tracking
│   └── quality_gate_monitoring: validation tracking
└── failure_detection/
    ├── workflow_stall_detection: stall indicators
    ├── agent_failure_detection: communication failure
    ├── context_corruption_detection: integrity checks
    └── quality_gate_failure_detection: repeated failures
```

**Recovery Triggers**:
- **Automatic**: Minor stalls, context integrity issues, communication failures
- **Manual**: Major workflow failures, cascading quality gate failures, strategic issues
