# BOKF Modernization - Overall Workflow

## High-Level Architecture

**Workflow Pattern**: 7-Phase Sequential Orchestration with Sub-Orchestrator Coordination

**Core Sequence**: Douglas → Dominic (11 domains) → Douglas → Tina (technical + consolidation) → Douglas

  - Dominic processes domain (150+ requirements → business capabilities)
  - Dominic signals completion to Douglas
  - Douglas validates quality, approves, assigns next domain
  
- **Per-Domain Workflow** (repeated 11 times):
  - Requirements extraction from master document
  - Capability synthesis and consolidation
  - Cross-domain integration analysis (progressive)
  - Business value assessment
  - Stakeholder validation framework creation
  - Context compression for next domain
