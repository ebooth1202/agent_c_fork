# Kanban Board Visualization

## Workflow Overview

The issue tracking system follows this workflow:

1. **Backlog** - New issues are added here
2. **To Do** - Prioritized issues ready to be worked on
3. **In Progress** - Issues currently being worked on
4. **Review** - Issues awaiting feedback or review
5. **Completed** - Finished issues

Issues can move backward in the workflow if needed (e.g., from Review back to In Progress if changes are required).

## Issue Statistics (Sample)

- **Backlog**: 2 issues
- **To Do**: 2 issues
- **In Progress**: 2 issues
- **Review**: 1 issue
- **Completed**: 2 issues

## Using the System

To use this kanban-style tracking system:

1. Add new issues to the backlog.md file
2. As you prioritize work, move issues to todo.md
3. When you start working on an issue, move it to in_progress.md
4. Add time tracking entries as you work
5. When ready for feedback, move to review.md
6. Once completed and approved, move to completed.md

Maintain the issue ID sequence when creating new issues (ISSUE-010 would be next).
