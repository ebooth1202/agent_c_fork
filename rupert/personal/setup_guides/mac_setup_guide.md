cd dockerfiles
```

**What this does**: 
- `cd` means "change directory" (like opening a folder)
- This takes you to the Agent C dockerfiles folder

**Tip**: If you get "No such file or directory", make sure:
- You moved the agent_c folder to your home directory
- You renamed it to exactly `agent_c` (no spaces, all lowercase)

### 4.3 Make the Script Executable

Type this command and press Enter:

```bash
chmod +x start_agent_c.sh
```

**What this does**: Gives permission for the startup script to run (Mac security feature)

You won't see any output - that's normal!

### 4.4 Run Agent C for the First Time

Type this command and press Enter:

```bash
./start_agent_c.sh
```

**What happens next:**
