          \ one specific deliverable\n   - **Clear Success Criteria** - Every clone\
          \ task has measurable completion\n   - **Fallback Protocols** - What to\
          \ do when clone tasks fail\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Authority Escalation Protocols**\n\
          \   ```\n   ### Shawn Wallace Escalation Discipline\n   - **Batch Related\
          \ Issues** - Don't overwhelm with individual requests\n   - **Priority Classification**\
          \ - Critical vs. routine escalation\n   - **Preparation Requirements** -\
          \ Complete documentation before escalation\n   - **Escalation Triggers**\
          \ - Clear criteria for when escalation is required\n   ```\n\n3. **Embed\
          \ Team Coordination Patterns**\n   ```\n   ### Team Member Coordination\
          \ Protocols\n   - **Douglas Coordination** - When and how to coordinate\
          \ with orchestrator\n   - **Peer Coordination** - When team members need\
          \ to coordinate directly\n   - **Work Handoff Protocols** - Proper handoff\
          \ between team members\n   - **Conflict Resolution** - How to handle coordination\
          \ conflicts\n   ```\n\n4. **Add Context Management Discipline**\n   ```\n\
          \   ### Context Burnout Prevention\n   - **Progressive Summarization** -\
          \ Extract key insights at each step\n   - **Context Window Monitoring**\
          \ - Proactive management of context limits\n   - **Recovery Protocols**\
          \ - What to do when context burnout occurs\n   - **Work State Preservation**\
          \ - Maintain resumption capability\n   ```\n\n**Validation Requirements:**\n\

        around clone failures by attempting multi-step execution themselves, leading
        to context window exhaustion and workflow failures.'

      lesson: 'Identified and resolved Tina''s clone tool failure root cause: clone
        task overload. Implemented comprehensive clone task decomposition and load
        management protocols including optimal clone task sizing (15-30 minutes focused
        work), multi-clone coordination workflows, and enhanced failure analysis to
        distinguish overload from other issues. Key insight: breaking large technical
        analysis tasks into 4-5 smaller clone tasks with proper sequencing and metadata
        handoffs prevents clone tool failures while maintaining analysis quality.
        Added concrete examples and checklists to prevent future overload issues.'

          tool failures by attempting to take on clone-level work themselves, leading
          to context burnout disasters and defeating the orchestration architecture.


          **Required Fixes:**


          1. **Strict Fallback Protocol**: If clone tool fails, agents must do NO
          MORE than the single step they would have assigned to the clone, then return
          control to orchestrator

          2. **Enhanced Subtask Tracking**: More diligent tracking of subtask assignments
          for resumption capability

          3. **Clone Delegation Discipline**: Reinforce that prime agents are coordinators,
          not executors


          **Implementation Areas:**


          - Add explicit clone delegation failure protocols to all three agents

          - Implement strict "single step only" fallback rules

          - Enhance subtask tracking and resumption capabilities

          - Add clear guidance on when to escalate vs. attempt workarounds

          - Reinforce orchestration vs. execution role boundaries


          **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**


          ✅ **Douglas (Orchestration Engine)**: Added comprehensive clone delegation
          discipline framework with strict fallback protocols, mandatory subtask tracking,
          and orchestration vs. execution role clarity


          ✅ **Dominic (Domain BA)**: Added domain coordinator discipline with single-step
          fallback rules, enhanced subtask tracking for domain analysis, and clear
          escalation protocols


          ✅ **Tina (Technical Architect)**: Added technical coordinator discipline
          with step-by-step fallback protocols, comprehensive subtask tracking for
          consolidation steps, and orchestrator integration


          **Key Enhancements Implemented:**


          1. **Mandatory Clone Delegation Rules**: Clear rules that prime agents NEVER
          attempt multi-step execution themselves

          2. **Strict Single-Step Fallback Protocol**: If clone tools fail, execute
          ONLY the single step that would have been assigned, then return control

          3. **Comprehensive Subtask Tracking**: Detailed metadata structures for
          tracking delegations, failures, and resumption requirements

          4. **Role Clarity**: Reinforced that prime agents are coordinators/orchestrators,
          not detailed executors


          **Success Criteria:**

          - Prime agents never attempt to take on multi-step clone work

          - Clear fallback protocols when clone tools fail

          - Robust subtask tracking for resumption

          break down large tasks like "Analyze technical debt across all 11 domains"
          into 4-5 smaller, manageable clone tasks

          **Key Enhancements:**

          - **Optimal Clone Task Size**: 15-30 minutes of focused work per clone

          - **Task Decomposition**: Break large tasks into 4-5 smaller clone tasks

          - **Multi-Clone Workflows**: Coordinate multiple clones with sequential/parallel

          Components" reflecting current reality:


          **Key Updates Made:**

          1. **Accurate Technology Stack**: Documented Python 3.12+/FastAPI backend
          (not Node.js)

          2. **Real Component Descriptions**: Actual capabilities of agent_c_core,
          agent_c_tools, agent_c_api, agent_c_react_client

          3. **Correct Development Workflows**: pytest for backend testing, proper
          Python package management

          4. **Accurate Deployment**: Docker compose architecture with Redis, FastAPI,
          React services

          5. **Production-Ready Language**: Removed aspirational/target language,
          focused on current capabilities


          **Architecture Highlights:**

          - Python-based agent runtime with AsyncIO

          - FastAPI web service layer (not Express/Node.js)

          - React/TypeScript frontend with Vite (npm only for frontend)

          - Docker containerization with multi-service orchestration

          - Comprehensive testing with pytest (backend) and Vitest (frontend)


          **Critical Corrections:**

          - Emphasized Python development patterns vs Node.js assumptions

          - Clarified correct testing approaches (pytest, not npm scripts)

          - Documented actual build/deployment processes
