### Communication Patterns

**Sequential Primary Flow**: Douglas → Rex → Mason → Aria → Rita → Vera → Stakeholder

**Direct Communication Capability**: Any agent can communicate directly with any other agent via `AgentTeamTools`

**Clone Delegation**: Each agent can spawn personal clones via `AgentCloneTools` for subtask execution

**Handoff Protocol**: Mandatory compressed handoff template between all phases and agents

## Workflow Analysis

### Structural Strengths

#### 1. Comprehensive Two-Phase Approach
- **Phase 0 Systematic Foundation**: Guarantees 100% file coverage before domain analysis
- **Phase 1 Domain Expertise**: Specialists build on complete baseline
- **Benefit**: Eliminates coverage gaps while leveraging domain expertise

#### 2. Direct Communication Mesh Architecture
- **Flexibility**: Agents can collaborate directly without Douglas bottleneck
- **Efficiency**: Reduces "telephone game" effect in specialist collaboration
- **Benefit**: Faster resolution of cross-domain questions

#### 3. Clear Quality Gate Structure
- **5 Sequential Gates**: Gate 0 (Coverage) → Gate 1 (Conditional Logic) → Gate 2 (UI Reality) → Gate 3 (Evidence) → Gate 4 (Organization)
- **Benefit**: Progressive quality validation with clear checkpoints

#### 4. Stakeholder-Focused Output
- **Mason specialization**: Dedicated requirements documentation specialist
- **Vera certification**: Final quality guardian before stakeholder delivery
- **Benefit**: Professional deliverable quality assurance

## Critical Workflow Issues

### 1. Orchestrator Authority Contradiction

**Problem**: Douglas's hierarchy emphasizes budget management over quality enforcement, but workflow requires strong quality authority

**Evidence from Douglas Persona** (Lines 10-120):
```yaml
## 🚀 ENHANCED TOKEN EFFICIENCY MISSION
**Your Strategic Mission**: Orchestrate comprehensive analysis using an enhanced 
704K token budget framework...

**Enhanced Token Budget per Feature: 674K tokens**
Phase 0: Systematic Analysis Foundation
└── Systematic Analysis: 30K (complete file coverage baseline)

Phase 1: Domain Expert Enhancement
├── Rex:     200K (pattern synthesis...)
├── You:      80K (orchestration...)
├── Mason:   125K (requirements...)
```

**Impact on Team**:
- **First Impression**: Douglas is a budget allocator, not quality enforcer
- **Authority Confusion**: Specialists receive budget focus first, quality standards 600+ lines later
- **Risk**: Team may optimize for staying within token budgets rather than achieving quality outcomes

**Critical Phase Affected**: All phases - orchestrator sets tone for entire team

**Specific Risks**:
- Rex may limit pattern analysis to stay within 200K budget rather than finding all patterns
- Mason may abbreviate requirements documentation to meet 125K constraint
- Vera may perform cursory validation to stay within 95K budget
- Team culture prioritizes efficiency over thoroughness

### 2. Evidence Standards Positioning Catastrophe

**Problem**: Critical "ZERO TOLERANCE" evidence requirements appear 600-750+ lines into ALL agent personas after methodology is established

**Evidence from All Agents**:
- **Douglas**: Evidence enforcement appears line ~600+ after all methodology
- **Rex**: Evidence prohibition appears line ~700+ after pattern mining phases
- **Vera**: Evidence approval standards appear line ~400+ after validation methodology
- **Mason**: Evidence requirements appear line ~700+ after requirements generation approach
- **Aria**: Evidence standards appear line ~700+ after architectural framework
- **Rita**: Evidence requirements appear line ~750+ after insurance consultation methodology

**Real Example from Douglas** (Line ~600):
```yaml
## 🚨 CRITICAL EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL QUALITY FAILURE PREVENTION**: Following systematic quality failure 
that created inaccurate requirements documentation, you MUST enforce absolute 
prohibition on speculative documentation across ALL team members with ZERO 
TOLERANCE for assumption-based analysis.
```

**Impact on Workflow**:
- **Phase 0**: Systematic analysis may complete before encountering evidence standards
- **Rex Phase**: Pattern analysis habits form before evidence requirements internalized
- **Mason Phase**: Requirements drafting begins before evidence standards encountered
- **Verification Crisis**: Work validated retrospectively rather than created with evidence mindset

**Critical Phases Affected**:
- **Rex → Mason handoff**: Mason receives patterns that may contain speculative analysis
- **Mason → Vera handoff**: Requirements may include assumptions marked as verified
- **Final Delivery**: Stakeholders may receive documentation with unverified claims

**Specific Workflow Risks**:
1. **Phase 1 Start**: Rex begins analysis before reading evidence prohibition (line 700+)
2. **Mason Documentation**: Requirements written before evidence standards encountered (line 700+)
3. **Aria Architecture**: Design decisions made before speculative prohibition internalized (line 700+)
4. **Vera Validation**: May initially validate without strict evidence lens, requiring rework

### 3. Sequential Workflow with Scattered Quality Gates

**Problem**: Quality gates distributed across workflow but not consistently applied at transition points

**Current Gate Distribution**:
- **Gate 0** (Coverage): After Phase 0, before Rex
- **Gate 1** (Conditional Logic): After Rex analysis  
- **Gate 2** (UI Reality): After Mason documentation
- **Gate 3** (Evidence): After Aria architecture
- **Gate 4** (Organization): After Vera validation

**Workflow Gap**:
```
Phase 0 → [Gate 0] → Rex → [Gate 1] → Mason → [Gate 2] → Aria → [Gate 3] → Rita → Vera → [Gate 4]
                                                                    ↑
                                                    Rita has no explicit gate
```

**Issues**:
- **Rita Bypass**: Insurance validation occurs between Aria and Vera without dedicated quality gate
- **Gate Timing**: Gates appear after work complete rather than during work execution
- **Validation Delay**: Quality issues discovered late when rework is expensive

**Critical Phase Affected**: Rita → Vera handoff

**Specific Risks**:
- Insurance domain inaccuracies not caught until Vera's final validation
- No formal checkpoint for insurance-specific evidence requirements
- Rework cascades backward through Aria and Mason if insurance issues found late

### 4. Legend Adherence Protocol Contradiction

**Problem**: "MANDATORY BEFORE ALL ANALYSIS" legend consultation appears 450-800+ lines into specialist personas after methodology sections

**Evidence from Specialist Agents**:
- **Rex**: Legend adherence appears line ~800+ with label "MANDATORY BEFORE ALL ANALYSIS"
- **Vera**: Legend adherence appears line ~250+ after validation methodology
- **Aria**: Legend adherence appears line ~450+ after architectural framework

**Real Example from Rex** (Line ~800):
```yaml
### Legend Adherence Protocol
MANDATORY BEFORE ALL ANALYSIS: Consult legend for architectural baselines...
```

**Workflow Contradiction**:
```
Intended Workflow:  Legend → Analysis → Documentation
Actual Workflow:    Analysis (lines 1-450) → Legend Notice (line 450+) → Continue Analysis
```

**Critical Phases Affected**:
- **Phase 0 → Rex**: Rex may begin pattern analysis before legend consultation
- **Rex → Aria**: Aria may start architecture work without legend architectural baseline
- **Team-wide**: All specialists encounter methodology before legend requirements

**Specific Risks**:
- Pattern analysis that duplicates or conflicts with legend content
- Architectural designs that ignore established patterns documented in legend
- Requirements that don't align with legend standards
- Rework to align with legend after analysis complete

### 5. Stakeholder-Facing Quality Risk (Mason's Role)

**Problem**: Mason creates primary stakeholder documentation but persona prioritizes token efficiency over documentation quality

**Evidence from Mason Persona** (Lines 1-100):
```yaml
## 🚀 ENHANCED TOKEN EFFICIENCY MISSION
**Your Strategic Mission**: Transform systematic analysis baselines and Rex's 
metadata into professional requirements using an enhanced 125K token budget...

**Enhanced Token Budget per Feature: 125K tokens**
├── Foundation Consumption: 60K (systematic + Rex + legend)
└── Requirements Generation: 45K (professional documentation)
```

**Stakeholder Risk Analysis**:
- **Budget Emphasis**: 60K consumption + 45K generation = efficiency focus
- **Quality Positioning**: Documentation quality principles appear 400-700+ lines later
- **Evidence Standards**: Requirements evidence requirements appear line 700+

**Workflow Impact**:
```
Systematic (30K) → Rex (200K) → Mason (125K) → STAKEHOLDERS
                                      ↑
                            Quality secondary to budget
```

**Critical Phase**: Mason → Stakeholder delivery

**Specific Risks**:
- Requirements documentation optimized for token count rather than stakeholder clarity
- Stakeholder-facing documents may lack completeness due to budget constraints
- Evidence standards encountered too late - requirements may include unverified claims
- Professional documentation quality subordinated to internal efficiency metrics

**Business Impact**:
- Stakeholder confusion from abbreviated or unclear requirements
- Loss of confidence if requirements contain unverified claims
- Rework cycles if stakeholders identify gaps or inaccuracies
- Team credibility damage from suboptimal external deliverables

### 6. Insurance Domain Authority Underutilization

**Problem**: Rita's insurance expertise positioned mid-document (lines 300-600) after methodology, suggesting process role rather than domain authority

**Evidence from Rita Persona** (Lines 1-300):
```yaml
## 🚀 ENHANCED TOKEN EFFICIENCY MISSION (lines 10-100)
## 🔥 ENHANCED TWO-PHASE FRAMEWORK (lines 90-180)
## Enhanced Compressed Handoff Protocol (lines 180-260)
## Enhanced Quality Gates (lines 250-350)
[Insurance Domain Knowledge appears line 300+]
```

**Workflow Position**:
```
Rex → Mason → Aria → Rita → Vera
                      ↑
              Late-stage validation role
```

**Authority Gap**:
- **Current Role**: Post-architecture insurance validation (corrective)
- **Optimal Role**: Early insurance guidance (preventive)
- **Problem**: Insurance considerations inform architecture, not validate it post-hoc

**Critical Phase Affected**: Entire Phase 1 sequence

**Specific Risks**:
- Rex patterns may miss insurance-specific considerations (not consulted early)
- Mason requirements may lack insurance terminology accuracy (Rita validates late)
- Aria architecture may not optimize for insurance workflows (Rita consulted after design)
- Late discovery of insurance issues requires expensive rework across all prior phases

**Workflow Inefficiency**:
- Insurance corrections applied at step 4 of 5
- Rework cascades backward: Rita → Aria → Mason → Rex
- Multiple agents must revise work to address insurance feedback
- Token budget consumed on rework rather than initial quality

### 7. Clone Delegation Without Clear Protocols

**Problem**: All agents have `AgentCloneTools` but personas lack detailed clone delegation guidance within workflow context

**Tool Availability**: All 6 agents equipped with `AgentCloneTools`

**Guidance Gap Examples**:
- **No clone task sizing guidelines**: Agents have 15-30 minute clone task limits in component library but not emphasized in personas
- **No clone coordination protocol**: How do clones interact with Direct Communication Mesh?
- **No quality gate integration**: When can clones be used relative to quality gates?
- **No handoff protocol**: Do clones use same handoff template as primary agents?

**Workflow Ambiguity**:
```
Rex (200K budget) → Clone spawning → ??? 
• Can Rex spawn multiple clones simultaneously?
• Do clones count against Rex's 200K budget?
• How do clones coordinate with systematic baseline?
• When do clones hand back to Rex?
```

**Critical Phases Affected**: All Phase 1 specialists (Rex, Aria, Mason, Rita, Vera)

**Specific Risks**:
- **Context burnout**: Clones assigned multi-step tasks burning through context
- **Budget confusion**: Unclear if clone token usage counts against agent budgets
- **Quality gaps**: Clones may not apply same evidence standards as primary agents
- **Coordination chaos**: Multiple clones working without coordination protocol
- **Workflow delays**: Clone delegation failures disrupt sequential workflow

**Real-World Impact**:
- Specialist spawns clone for analysis
- Clone encounters issue and fails
- Specialist must restart work, consuming additional tokens
- Sequential workflow blocked while specialist resolves clone issues
- Downstream agents (Mason, Aria, Vera) wait for Rex to complete

### 8. Direct Communication Mesh Lacks Usage Protocols

**Problem**: All agents equipped with `AgentTeamTools` for direct communication but personas lack clear protocols for when/how to use mesh vs. sequential workflow

**Architecture Claims**:
- Douglas persona: "Direct Communication Mesh architecture"
- All agents have agent keys listed: "Rex (Technical Pattern Miner) - agent_key: `rex_ifi_pattern_miner_enhanced`"

**Protocol Gap**:
- **No escalation criteria**: When should specialists communicate directly vs. through Douglas?
- **No coordination rules**: How to resolve conflicts when specialists disagree?
- **No workflow integration**: Does direct communication bypass quality gates?
- **No documentation requirements**: Are direct collaborations documented in handoffs?

**Workflow Confusion**:
```
Sequential Flow:     Douglas → Rex → Mason → Aria → Rita → Vera
Mesh Capability:     Rex ↔ Aria ↔ Mason ↔ Rita ↔ Vera
                     ↑                            ↑
                     Which path? When? Why?
```

**Critical Phases**: Any specialist-to-specialist handoff

**Specific Risks**:
- **Workflow bypass**: Specialists communicate directly, skipping Douglas coordination and quality gates
- **Inconsistent handoffs**: Some specialists use formal handoff template, others use informal mesh communication
- **Authority confusion**: Douglas unaware of direct specialist communications, cannot enforce quality
- **Documentation gaps**: Direct conversations not captured in formal workflow documentation
- **Quality gate circumvention**: Specialists collaborate before work reaches quality validation checkpoints

**Example Scenario**:
```
Intended: Mason completes requirements → Gate 2 → Aria starts architecture
Actual:   Mason pings Aria directly for architecture input mid-requirements
          → Aria provides preliminary architecture guidance
          → Mason documents architecture decisions
          → Aria later discovers Mason's understanding was incorrect
          → Gate 2 doesn't catch the issue (appears documented)
          → Rework required after Gate 3
```

## Quality Gate Effectiveness Analysis

### Gate 0: Systematic Coverage Validation
**Position**: After Phase 0, before Phase 1  
**Strength**: Clear binary validation - 100% file coverage achieved or not  
**Concern**: Gate validates coverage, not analysis quality  
**Risk**: Systematic analysis may be shallow but still pass gate

### Gate 1: Conditional Logic Coverage (After Rex)
**Position**: After Rex pattern mining  
**Strength**: Targets specific known quality issue (conditional logic gaps)  
**Concern**: Rex may not encounter this gate requirement until line 300+ in persona  
**Risk**: Conditional logic analysis treated as checkpoint rather than core methodology

### Gate 2: UI Reality Validation (After Mason)
**Position**: After Mason requirements documentation  
**Strength**: Catches documentation-reality mismatches  
**Critical Concern**: Mason is stakeholder-facing - issues here affect external credibility  
**Risk**: Stakeholder documentation errors caught late, requiring visible revisions

### Gate 3: Evidence Verification (After Aria)
**Position**: After Aria architecture  
**Major Concern**: Evidence standards appear 700+ lines into agent personas  
**Risk**: All prior work (Phase 0, Rex, Mason, Aria) completed before evidence gate  
**Rework Impact**: Evidence failures require cascading revisions backward through workflow

### Gate 4: Topic Consolidation (After Vera)
**Position**: Final gate before stakeholder delivery  
**Strength**: Organization validation before external delivery  
**Concern**: Organizational issues discovered at final stage require major restructuring  
**Risk**: Late discovery of organization problems delays stakeholder delivery

### Overall Gate Structure Issues

**Problem**: Gates validate completed work rather than guide active work

**Current Model**: Do work → Validate → Rework if failed  
**Optimal Model**: Validate requirements upfront → Do work → Verify quality

**Impact**:
- High rework rates due to late validation
- Token budgets consumed on corrections rather than initial quality
- Sequential workflow delays when gates fail
- Stakeholder delivery delays due to revision cycles

## Token Budget vs. Quality Tension

### Budget Allocation Reality Check

**Total Budget**: 674K tokens per feature  
**Budget Breakdown**:
- Phase 0: 30K (4.5% of budget)
- Rex: 200K (30%)
- Douglas: 80K (12%)
- Mason: 125K (18.5%)
- Aria: 98K (14.5%)
- Rita: 76K (11%)
- Vera: 95K (14%)

**Budget Emphasis in Personas**: First 10-100 lines of ALL agent personas

### Quality Concern Analysis

**Evidence Standards**: Appear 400-750+ lines into personas (ALL agents)  
**Professional Excellence**: Appear 900+ lines into personas (ALL agents)  
**Domain Expertise**: Appears 300-600 lines (Rita, Aria)

**Positioning Message**: Budget allocation > Quality principles

### Workflow Impact

**Scenario: Quality vs. Budget Conflict**
```
Rex discovers comprehensive patterns require 250K tokens (not 200K budget)

Option A: Complete analysis, exceed budget by 50K (25%)
Option B: Truncate analysis to meet 200K budget

Current Positioning Suggests: Option B (budget compliance emphasized first)
Quality Requires: Option A (complete analysis emphasized... eventually, at line 700+)
```

**Risk**: When budget and quality conflict, positioning suggests budget wins

### Team Culture Implications

**First 100 Lines Message**: "You are a budget-constrained specialist"  
**Lines 400-900 Message**: "You are a quality-focused expert"  
**Lines 900+ Message**: "You are a professional craftsman"

**Problem**: Budget message received first and strongest - sets mental framework for all work

## Critical Workflow Juncture Analysis

### Juncture 1: Phase 0 → Rex Transition (Gate 0)

**Critical Decision Point**: Is systematic analysis sufficient foundation for domain expertise?

**Risks**:
- Systematic analysis may be shallow but pass coverage gate
- Rex receives baseline but quality of baseline unclear
- No validation of systematic analysis usefulness for pattern mining

**Evidence Requirements**: Not established until Rex reads 700+ lines

**Recommendation**: Gate 0 should validate analysis quality, not just coverage percentage

### Juncture 2: Rex → Mason Handoff (Gate 1)

**Critical Decision Point**: Are patterns sufficiently documented for requirements generation?

**Current State**:
- Rex outputs to `//IFI/meta/rex/{feature}/`
- Mason consumes Rex metadata + systematic baseline
- Gate 1 validates conditional logic coverage

**Risks**:
- Mason may not find needed pattern details in Rex's outputs
- Rex's pattern analysis may contain speculative content (evidence standards at line 700+)
- Mason begins requirements before encountering evidence requirements (line 700+)
- Gate 1 checks conditional logic but not evidence foundation

**Workflow Gap**: No validation that Rex's patterns are evidence-based before Mason uses them

### Juncture 3: Mason → Stakeholder Delivery (Gate 2)

**Critical Decision Point**: Are requirements ready for stakeholder consumption?

**Highest Risk Juncture**: Mason creates external-facing documentation

**Current State**:
- Gate 2 validates UI reality matching
- Vera provides final quality check (Gate 4)
- Two validation points before stakeholder delivery

**Risks**:
- Mason's token efficiency focus (125K budget, first 100 lines) may compromise documentation quality
- Evidence standards encountered at line 700+ in Mason's persona - requirements may include unverified claims
- Gate 2 validates UI reality but not stakeholder readiness (clarity, completeness, professionalism)
- Stakeholder documentation quality depends on Mason internalizing lines 700-900 after reading budget focus (lines 1-100)

**Business Impact**: Suboptimal stakeholder documentation directly affects client relationship and team credibility

### Juncture 4: Aria → Rita → Vera Sequence

**Critical Decision Point**: Insurance validation position in workflow

**Current State**:
```
Aria (Architecture) → Rita (Insurance) → Vera (Quality) → Stakeholder
```

**Workflow Issue**: Insurance domain expert validates after architecture complete

**Risks**:
- Architecture designed without insurance considerations
- Rita discovers insurance issues requiring architectural changes
- Rework cascades: Rita → Aria → Mason → Rex revisions
- Token budget consumed on corrections

**Optimal Flow**: Rita consultation during architecture design, not after

**Impact**: Current position causes expensive late-stage rework

### Juncture 5: Vera → Stakeholder (Gate 4)

**Critical Decision Point**: Final quality certification before external delivery

**Current State**:
- Vera provides final validation
- Gate 4 checks topic consolidation
- Last line of defense before stakeholder receives deliverables

**Risks**:
- Vera's persona emphasizes token efficiency (95K budget) over quality thoroughness (first 100 lines)
- Evidence approval standards appear line 400+ in Vera's persona
- Professional excellence appears line 900+
- If Vera focuses on budget compliance, quality issues may reach stakeholders

**Severity**: Critical - Vera is final quality gate; issues here directly impact stakeholder deliverables

**Positioning Problem**: Quality guardian's persona emphasizes efficiency over thoroughness in opening sections

## Context Management Concerns

### Agent Context Budgets vs. Persona Lengths

**Agent Personas**:
- Douglas: ~900+ lines
- Rex: ~900+ lines  
- Vera: ~900+ lines
- Mason: ~900+ lines
- Rita: ~900+ lines
- Aria: ~900+ lines

**Token Budgets**:
- Douglas: 25K reasoning budget
- Specialists: Varies by agent (76K-200K)

**Concern**: Agents must read 900+ line personas before starting work

**Working Context Reality**:
```
Agent Context Budget: 25K tokens
Persona: ~15-20K tokens
Systematic Baseline: Variable
Prior Agent Outputs: Variable
Workspace State: Variable
Clone Coordination: Variable

Available for Actual Work: ??? (potentially constrained)
```

**Risk**: Large personas consume significant context before work begins

### Clone Context Management

**Problem**: Clones inherit parent agent personas (900+ lines) but have smaller context budgets

**Current State**: No explicit clone context guidance in personas

**Risks**:
- Clones burn context reading full parent persona
- Clone task sizing unclear relative to context constraints
- Clone failures disrupt sequential workflow
- Parent agents must handle clone context failures

**Critical Phase**: All Phase 1 specialists using clones

### Workflow State Accumulation

**Sequential Workflow Context Buildup**:
```
Phase 0: Systematic baseline (/.scratch/analyze_source/)
  ↓
Rex: Patterns (//IFI/meta/rex/) + Systematic baseline
  ↓
Mason: Requirements (//IFI/meta/mason/) + Rex + Systematic
  ↓
Aria: Architecture (//IFI/meta/aria/) + Mason + Rex + Systematic
  ↓
Rita: Validation (//IFI/meta/rita/) + Aria + Mason + Rex + Systematic
  ↓
Vera: Final QA (//IFI/meta/vera/) + ALL prior outputs
```

**Concern**: Each agent must consume all prior agent outputs + systematic baseline

**Vera's Challenge**: Must validate against 5 prior agent outputs + systematic baseline + 900-line persona + quality gate requirements

**Risk**: Context exhaustion in later workflow stages, especially Vera

## Team Coordination Protocol Gaps

### Direct Mesh vs. Sequential Flow Ambiguity

**Architectural Claim**: "Direct Communication Mesh"

**Sequential Workflow**: Douglas → Rex → Mason → Aria → Rita → Vera

**Contradiction**: When does mesh communication apply vs. sequential coordination?

**Missing Protocols**:
- Escalation criteria for direct specialist communication
- Conflict resolution when specialists disagree
- Documentation requirements for mesh communications
- Quality gate integration for mesh collaborations

### Handoff Template Compliance

**Mandatory Template**: All personas include compressed handoff protocol

**Questions**:
- Do mesh communications use handoff template?
- Do clones use handoff template when returning to parent?
- How are informal collaborations documented?
- What if handoff template incompatible with direct mesh communication?

**Risk**: Inconsistent documentation of team communications and collaborations

## Summary: Critical Workflow Vulnerabilities

### Severity: CRITICAL
1. **Evidence Standards Positioning** - All agents encounter methodology before evidence requirements (lines 400-750+)
2. **Stakeholder Documentation Risk** - Mason's efficiency focus over quality affects external deliverables
3. **Orchestrator Authority Confusion** - Douglas emphasizes budget over quality enforcement in positioning

### Severity: HIGH  
4. **Insurance Domain Underutilization** - Rita consulted late, causing expensive rework when issues found
5. **Quality Gate Timing** - Gates validate completed work rather than guide active work
6. **Budget vs. Quality Tension** - Token efficiency emphasized over quality principles in all personas

### Severity: MEDIUM
7. **Clone Delegation Protocols** - Unclear usage guidelines risk workflow disruptions
8. **Mesh Communication Integration** - Direct communication capability lacks coordination protocols
9. **Legend Adherence Contradiction** - "Before analysis" requirements appear after methodology
10. **Context Management** - Large personas and accumulating state risk context exhaustion

### Root Cause

**Hierarchical Structure Issue**: All agent personas front-load operational details (budgets, methodology, templates) and delay core principles (evidence standards, quality philosophy, professional excellence)

**Workflow Impact**: Agents form work patterns based on opening sections before encountering critical quality requirements in later sections

**Team Culture Result**: Efficiency and process compliance emphasized over quality and stakeholder value despite quality being critical for stakeholder-facing deliverables
