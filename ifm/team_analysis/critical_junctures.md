**5 Critical Junctures** where workflow failure risk is highest.

---

## Juncture 1: Phase 0 → Phase 1 Transition
### Systematic Baseline Handoff

**What Happens:**
Douglas completes exploratory discovery and must transition to systematic analysis. The baseline includes: code structure understanding, initial domain insights, stakeholder context, and identified complexity zones. This handoff activates Rex's systematic mining protocol.

**Success Criteria:**
- Documented baseline includes concrete findings (not just "we looked at X")
- Complexity zones identified with specific examples
- Clear scope boundaries for Rex's mining work
- Stakeholder priorities captured in actionable format

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Vague Discovery Output** - "We reviewed the codebase" without specific findings → Rex mines blindly
2. **Scope Creep Artifacts** - Undocumented scope decisions → Rex analyzes out-of-scope areas
3. **Missing Stakeholder Context** - Rex produces technically sound but irrelevant patterns

**Impact if Failure:**
Rex wastes 40-60% of Phase 1 time mining irrelevant patterns or re-discovering baseline information. Team burns through budget before reaching architecture phase. Stakeholders receive patterns that don't address their actual priorities.

---

## Juncture 2: Rex → Mason
### Pattern to Requirements Translation

**What Happens:**
Rex delivers mined patterns (business capabilities, domain concepts, integration points) to Mason. Mason must translate these patterns into structured requirements that Aria can architect against. This is pattern → formal specification conversion.

**Success Criteria:**
- Requirements traceable to specific Rex patterns
- Technical constraints documented (not just capabilities)
- Integration points defined with directionality (source/target)
- Non-functional requirements captured (performance, security, compliance)

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Pattern Loss in Translation** - Requirements don't reflect Rex's findings → architecture misses critical domain concepts
2. **Missing Constraint Documentation** - Mason captures "what" but not "why not" → Aria designs unimplementable solutions
3. **Fuzzy Integration Requirements** - "System X integrates with System Y" lacks detail → Rita can't validate insurance implications

**Impact if Failure:**
Aria architects against incomplete requirements, leading to rework cycles. Insurance validation becomes guesswork. The team discovers integration constraints during implementation (too late, high cost to fix).

---

## Juncture 3: Mason → Aria
### Requirements to Architecture Transformation

**What Happens:**
Mason hands off structured requirements. Aria must create domain-driven architecture that's both technically sound AND insurance-domain-appropriate. This handoff triggers Aria's C# context mapping and strategic design decisions.

**Success Criteria:**
- Requirements package includes domain model elements (entities, aggregates, bounded contexts)
- Technical constraints explicitly stated
- Integration requirements specify protocols and data formats
- Priority indicators help Aria focus architectural effort

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Under-Specified Domain Model** - Mason provides features without domain structure → Aria invents domain model (high risk of insurance domain violations)
2. **Ambiguous Integration Requirements** - "Connects to policy system" → Aria can't determine integration patterns
3. **Missing Priority Signals** - Aria over-architects low-priority areas, under-architects critical paths

**Impact if Failure:**
Rita spends excessive time correcting domain model violations. Architecture rework required when insurance constraints surface. Integration designs fail during detailed validation, requiring component redesign.

---

## Juncture 4: Aria → Rita
### Architecture to Insurance Validation

**What Happens:**
Aria delivers domain-driven architecture documentation. Rita validates ALL insurance-specific implications: regulatory compliance, domain model correctness, underwriting business rules, policy lifecycle integrity, and data governance. This is the insurance "red team" checkpoint.

**Success Criteria:**
- Architecture documentation includes clear domain model (contexts, aggregates, entities)
- Integration patterns show data flows
- Business rule locations identified
- Compliance touchpoints documented
- Architecture stable enough for detailed validation (not draft-quality)

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Premature Handoff** - Aria submits draft-quality architecture → Rita wastes time validating unstable design
2. **Insufficient Domain Model Detail** - Rita can't evaluate insurance correctness without domain structure visibility
3. **Hidden Compliance Gaps** - Architecture doesn't expose regulatory touchpoints → Rita misses critical compliance issues

**Impact if Failure:**
Major architecture rework after insurance violations discovered. Compliance risks identified too late (expensive to fix, potential project blockers). Business stakeholders lose confidence in technical team's insurance domain understanding.

---

## Juncture 5: Vera → Stakeholder
### Final Certification to Delivery

**What Happens:**
Vera completes test strategy and quality certification. This includes: validated domain model, insurance compliance confirmation, integration test strategy, and risk assessment. The package must give stakeholders confidence to proceed with implementation planning/budgeting.

**Success Criteria:**
- Test strategy covers all critical paths (underwriting, claims, policy lifecycle)
- Known risks documented with mitigation approaches
- Quality metrics defined for implementation phase
- Stakeholder-readable executive summary provided
- Insurance compliance certification explicit

**Failure Modes:**
1. **Technical-Only Certification** - Vera focuses on test coverage, misses business readiness assessment → stakeholders can't make go/no-go decision
2. **Undiscovered Risk Gaps** - Test strategy doesn't expose integration or compliance risks → stakeholders surprised during implementation
3. **Non-Stakeholder-Friendly Output** - Certification too technical → stakeholders can't extract decision-making information

**Impact if Failure:**
Stakeholders either reject the deliverable (project stalls) or approve with hidden risks (implementation surprises, budget overruns). Implementation team lacks clear quality targets. Insurance compliance issues discovered during development (very expensive).

## Juncture Priority Ranking

**Highest Risk:**
1. **Juncture 4** (Aria → Rita) - Insurance validation failure = compliance risk
2. **Juncture 2** (Rex → Mason) - Pattern loss = wrong solution built correctly

**Medium Risk:**
3. **Juncture 5** (Vera → Stakeholder) - Certification failure = project confidence loss
4. **Juncture 3** (Mason → Aria) - Requirement ambiguity = rework cycles

**Lower Risk (but still critical):**
5. **Juncture 1** (Phase 0 → 1) - Baseline failure = inefficiency, but recoverable

---

## Operational Recommendations

**For Douglas (Orchestrator):**
- Implement **handoff checklists** for each juncture
- Require **explicit sign-off** at Junctures 2, 4, and 5
- Monitor for **premature handoffs** (especially Juncture 4)

**For Specialists:**
- **Rex**: Package patterns with stakeholder priority context
- **Mason**: Always document "why not" constraints, not just "what" requirements
- **Aria**: Flag areas needing Rita review BEFORE finalizing architecture
- **Rita**: Push back on premature/incomplete handoffs immediately
- **Vera**: Include business readiness assessment, not just technical certification

**Early Warning Signals:**
- Specialists requesting "just a quick look" at incomplete handoffs
- Rework requests flowing backward through junctures
- Stakeholder questions revealing missing context at handoff points
