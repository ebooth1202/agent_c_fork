# IFI Agent Team Repetition Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Agents Analyzed:** 6 (Rex, Vera, Douglas, Mason, Rita, Aria)

**Section Name:** `üö® CRITICAL EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS ENFORCEMENT - MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION`  
**Approximate Token Count:** 2,500-3,000 tokens per agent  
**Appears In:** ALL 6 agents (Rex, Vera, Douglas, Mason, Rita, Aria)  
**Repetition Type:** Near-identical (95%+ identical across all agents)

**Content Includes:**
- Absolute prohibition on speculative documentation (~400 tokens)
- Mandatory source code verification before any claim (~300 tokens)

**Example Identical Text:**
```
**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- Document conditional logic that "seems reasonable" without source verification

### Key Findings

1. **Highest Repetition:** Vera (59-75%) and Rex (52-65%)
2. **Lowest Repetition:** Douglas and Rita (~36-48%)
3. **Most Repeated Section:** Evidence-Based Analysis Enforcement (2,500-3,000 tokens in ALL 6 agents)
4. **Total Wasted Tokens Across Team:** If each repeated section appeared once and was referenced, the team could save approximately **25,000-30,000 tokens** in persona definitions

### Repetition by Content Type

| Content Type | Agents Affected | Total Tokens Consumed | Identical vs Varied |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Evidence-Based Analysis | 6/6 (ALL) | 15,000-18,000 | 95% identical |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Efficiency Opportunities

1. **Extract Evidence-Based Analysis Enforcement** to a shared component
   - **Savings:** 12,500-15,000 tokens across team (removing 5 copies)
   - **Impact:** Single source of truth for quality standards

2. **Create Handoff Protocol Template** as shared reference
   - **Savings:** 2,500-3,500 tokens across team
   - **Impact:** Consistent communication standards

3. **Consolidate Quality Gates** into base orchestrator guidance
   - **Savings:** 3,000-4,000 tokens across team
   - **Impact:** Unified quality framework

4. **Reference Legend Adherence** rather than duplicate
   - **Savings:** 2,000-3,000 tokens (for 3 agents)
   - **Impact:** Consistent legend compliance

### Potential Token Savings

**Conservative Estimate:** 20,000-25,000 tokens  
**Aggressive Estimate:** 25,000-30,000 tokens  

**Impact:** Could reduce average persona size from ~13,000 tokens to ~8,000-9,000 tokens (35-40% reduction)

---

## Conclusion

The IFI agent team exhibits **substantial content repetition (44-57% average)**, with the "Evidence-Based Analysis Enforcement" section being the single largest contributor. This repetition creates:

1. **Maintenance burden** - Updates must be synchronized across 6 files
2. **Inconsistency risk** - Variations creep in during updates
3. **Token inefficiency** - Personas consume ~6,300 tokens on average for repeated content
4. **Comprehension overhead** - Difficult to identify agent-unique capabilities

**Primary Recommendation:** Extract the top 4 repeated sections (Evidence-Based Analysis, Token Efficiency structure, Handoff Templates, Quality Gates) into shared component documents that can be referenced rather than duplicated.
