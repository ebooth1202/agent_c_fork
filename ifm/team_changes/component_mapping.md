## Summary

| Agent | Role | Component Count | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| Douglas | Orchestrator (Domo) | 11/13 | Includes Context Management, Clone Delegation, Human Pairing |
| Rex | Specialist | 9/13 | Standard specialist set |
| Vera | Specialist | 9/13 | Standard specialist set + quality focus |
| Mason | Specialist | 9/13 | Standard specialist set |
| Rita | Specialist | 9/13 | Standard specialist set + insurance focus |
| Aria | Specialist | 9/13 | Standard specialist set + architecture focus |

**Consistent Pattern**: All 5 specialists use same 9 components. Douglas adds Context Management, Clone Delegation, and Human Pairing as orchestrator.

## IFI-Specific Content to Condense

These sections appear in personas but are NOT standard components (will be condensed to 80% reduction):

1. **Evidence-Based Analysis Enforcement** (all 6 agents)
   - Current: 2,500-3,000 tokens
   - Target: 300-500 tokens
   - Focus: Insurance-specific evidence requirements only

2. **Compressed Handoff Protocol Template** (all 6 agents)
   - Current: 600-700 tokens
   - Target: 200-300 tokens
   - Focus: Key fields and format only

3. **Legend Adherence Protocol** (Rex, Vera, Aria)
   - Current: 1,000-1,500 tokens
   - Target: 200-300 tokens
   - Focus: Core mandate without verbose examples

4. **WCP/CGL Lessons Learned** (Rex, Vera)
   - Current: 1,500-2,000 tokens
   - Target: 300-500 tokens
   - Focus: Essential LOB patterns only

5. **LOB Work Protocol** (NEW - all agents)
   - Target: 100-150 tokens
   - Focus: Concise single-LOB mandate

## Next Steps

1. Use this mapping for each agent update
2. Reference standard components (don't duplicate)
3. Condense IFI-specific sections per targets above
4. Remove token efficiency sections entirely
5. Remove Phase 0 systematic analysis references
6. Reorder hierarchy: Quality → Core → Operational
