## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Workers' Compensation (WCP) quotation and application processes utilize **5 distinct modal window interactions** to collect underwriting information, validate coverage selections, and enforce business rules. These modals contain **dynamic question structures with conditional extra information requirements** that significantly impact quote eligibility and workflow progression.

**Key Requirements Extracted**:
- **27+ underwriting questions** in popup modal with conditional additional information fields
- **Critical ineligibility business rule** (Diamond Code 9107) that archives quotes and blocks progression  
- **Coverage-specific alert requirements** for sole proprietors and coverage deletions
- **Class code lookup modal** with risk grade definitions and search capabilities
- **Dynamic field validation** with character limits and visual error indicators

**Business Impact**: Modal interactions directly affect quote eligibility, customer experience, and underwriter workload through automated screening and information collection.

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS BY BUSINESS PROCESS

### 1. UNDERWRITING QUESTIONS COLLECTION PROCESS

#### 1.1 Primary Underwriting Questions Modal
**Business Purpose**: Collect critical underwriting information through structured popup window during WCP quote process  
**Source Evidence**: `ctlUWQuestionsPopup.ascx` integrated in `ctl_WorkflowMgr_Quote_WCP.ascx`

**Modal Window Requirements**:
- **Display Trigger**: Automatically displays during WCP quote workflow progression
- **Window Specifications**: 550-pixel wide popup window with "Underwriting Questions" title
- **User Control**: Non-draggable window that cannot be closed without completing all requirements
- **Effective Date Collection**: Integrated date picker with validation for policy effective dates

#### 1.2 Question Structure Requirements
**Source Evidence**: Repeater-driven table structure in `ctlUWQuestionsPopup.ascx`

**Question Display Pattern**:
- **Question Format**: Each underwriting question displayed with Yes/No radio button options
- **Question Source**: Dynamic questions retrieved from external underwriting system 
- **Visual Design**: Alternating gray row backgrounds for question readability
- **Required Selection**: All questions must have either Yes or No selected before modal can be submitted

**Example Question Types** (Based on BOP patterns in source - WCP-specific questions would follow same structure):
- Building size and construction questions
- Business operation and location questions  
- Coverage and liability questions
- Prior insurance and claims history questions

#### 1.3 Additional Information Requirements (Extra Info Boxes)

**Conditional Display Logic**:
- **Show Trigger**: Additional information text box appears **ONLY** when "Yes" is selected for any question
- **Hide Trigger**: Additional information text box hides and clears **ONLY** when "No" is selected
- **Source Evidence**: `ShowHideAdditionalInfo()` function in `ctlUWQuestionsPopup.ascx` lines 267-279

**Extra Info Box Validation Requirements**:
- **Mandatory Completion**: When "Yes" is selected, additional information becomes **required field**
- **Character Limit**: 125 characters maximum per additional information entry
- **Visual Error Indicators**: Red border around text box and red error message for incomplete required fields
- **Error Message**: "Additional Information Response Required" displays for empty required fields
- **Source Evidence**: `AllAdditionalInfoFieldsAreAnswered()` validation function lines 504-528

#### 1.4 Form Submission Validation Chain
**Multi-Layer Validation Requirements**:
1. **All Questions Answered**: Every question must have Yes or No selection
2. **Additional Info Completed**: All conditional additional information fields must be completed
3. **Effective Date Valid**: Policy effective date must fall within allowed date range
4. **LOB-Specific Questions**: Additional WCP-specific questions must be answered
5. **Source Evidence**: `ValidateUWForm()` function lines 824-870

**Validation Error Handling**:
- **Visual Indicators**: Red asterisk appears next to incomplete questions
- **Error Prevention**: Form cannot be submitted until all validation requirements met
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Border colors and error messages update immediately when validation fails

### 2. QUOTE ELIGIBILITY AND INELIGIBILITY MANAGEMENT

#### 2.1 Critical Ineligibility Business Rule - Diamond Code 9107
**Business Purpose**: Enforce automatic quote ineligibility for specific underwriting conditions  
**Source Evidence**: `HandleRadioButtonClicksWCP()` function in `ctlCommercialUWQuestionList.ascx` lines 316-351

**Ineligibility Trigger Requirements**:
- **Trigger Condition**: When Diamond Code 9107 question is answered "Yes"
- **Immediate Response**: System displays confirmation dialog: "The risk is ineligible, if answered 'Yes' in error select 'Cancel'. If answered correctly, select 'OK'"
- **Business Impact**: This is a **kill question** that terminates the quote process

**Quote Archival Process**:
- **Confirmed Ineligibility**: If user selects "OK" to confirm ineligible status
- **Automatic Actions**:
  1. Quote is automatically archived in system
  2. User is redirected to MyVelocirater main page
  3. Quote cannot be continued or modified
- **Error Recovery**: If user selects "Cancel", system resets answer to "No" and allows quote to continue
- **Source Evidence**: `ArchiveQuote()` function with JSON call to `GenHandlers/UWHandler.ashx`

**Business Rules**:
- **Ineligible Risk Definition**: Diamond Code 9107 represents a specific type of ineligible risk (exact criteria **UNVERIFIED - REQUIRES STAKEHOLDER CONFIRMATION**)
- **No Override Capability**: Once confirmed ineligible, quote cannot be recovered through user interface
- **Audit Trail**: Quote archival creates permanent record of ineligibility decision
