## EXTRA INFO BOX REQUIREMENTS COMPREHENSIVE

### **Conditional Display Rules** (Answers user's specific question)
1. **Show Trigger**: Additional information text box appears **immediately** when "Yes" selected for any underwriting question  
2. **Hide Trigger**: Text box hides and **clears content** when "No" selected  
3. **Always Show Exception**: Questions with `alwaysShow` class display text box regardless of answer  
4. **Never Show Exception**: Questions with `neverShow` class never display additional text box  

### **Validation Requirements** 
1. **Required Field Logic**: When "Yes" selected, additional information becomes **mandatory field**  
2. **Character Limit**: **125 characters maximum** per text box entry with real-time validation  
3. **Visual Error Indicators**:
   - **Red border** around text box for validation failures  
   - **Red error text**: "Additional Information Response Required"  
   - **Red asterisk** indicator for incomplete required questions  
4. **Form Submission Blocking**: All additional information must be completed before quote can advance  

### **Business Process Impact**
- **Quote Progression**: Cannot advance without complete additional information  
- **Underwriter Review**: Additional information provides critical context for risk assessment  
- **Audit Trail**: All additional information captured in permanent quote record  
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback prevents submission errors

## UNVERIFIED ITEMS REQUIRING STAKEHOLDER CONFIRMATION

The following items could not be fully verified from source code and require stakeholder input:

1. **WCP-Specific Question List**: What are the actual underwriting questions displayed in WCP modal? (Framework verified, specific questions not found in source)  
2. **Diamond Code 9107 Criteria**: What specific business conditions trigger this ineligibility code?  
3. **Always Show / Never Show Questions**: Which specific questions have permanent additional information display?  
4. **Risk Grade Workflow Impact**: How do risk grades 1-3 and P affect underwriting workflow beyond quote authority?  
5. **Sole Proprietor Documentation Process**: What happens if required health insurance documentation is not provided?  

**Recommendation**: Schedule stakeholder clarification session to verify these 5 items before development planning.
