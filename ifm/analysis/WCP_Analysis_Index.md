### Phase 2 Coordination Protocol

#### When User Requests Phase 2
**Process**: 
1. User validates Phase 1 documentation accuracy and completeness
2. User explicitly requests Phase 2 cross-functional analysis  
3. Douglas coordinates with Link agent (`link_cross_module_analyst`) for cross-module dependency analysis
4. Link receives complete Phase 1 documentation paths and produces cross-functional linkage document
5. Douglas delivers Phase 2 results: "Phase 2 complete. Here's the cross-functional linkage analysis from Link..."

#### Phase 2 Inputs Available for Link
- **Complete WCP Analysis**: All team outputs consolidated and organized
- **Source Code Context**: Primary analysis target (VelociRater) and reference systems identified
- **Technical Patterns**: Comprehensive pattern catalog with integration points documented  
- **Business Context**: Complete requirements specifications and domain validation
