## Core Principles

**Binary Decision Model**: All contributions must maintain clear YES/NO usage decisions.

**Evidence-Based**: Propose components based on real agent building experience, not theory.

**Component Independence**: Each component must work standalone without dependencies.

**Keep It Simple**: Favor clarity and simplicity over complexity.
