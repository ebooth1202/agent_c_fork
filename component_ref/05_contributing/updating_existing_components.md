# Updating Existing Components

This guide provides processes and guidelines for improving existing components in the Agent Component Reference Library while maintaining the binary decision model and ensuring backward compatibility.

## When to Update Existing Components

### Strong Indicators for Component Updates

**Effectiveness Improvements** (High priority):
- **Better Patterns Discovered**: New approach produces significantly better agent outcomes
- **Usage Data Shows Issues**: Analytics reveal components need frequent customization
- **Community Reports Problems**: Multiple builders report confusion or implementation difficulties
- **Real-World Evidence**: Production agent usage shows component gaps or inefficiencies

**Quality Enhancements** (Medium priority):
- **Clarity Improvements**: Instructions can be made clearer or more actionable
- **Better Examples**: More effective usage examples have been identified
- **Structural Improvements**: Component organization can be improved
- **Documentation Gaps**: Missing customization guidance or implementation notes

**Evolution Updates** (Ongoing):
- **New Context**: Component needs adaptation for new agent types or use cases
- **Technology Changes**: Underlying tools or methods have evolved
- **Pattern Refinement**: Usage experience reveals better implementation approaches
- **Integration Improvements**: Better compatibility with other components

### When NOT to Update Components

**Avoid updates when**:
- ❌ **No Evidence of Problems**: Component works well and no issues reported
- ❌ **Minor Preferences**: Changes are stylistic rather than functional improvements
- ❌ **Breaking Changes**: Updates would break existing agent implementations
- ❌ **Complexity Addition**: Updates add conditional logic or complexity to binary model

### Update Assessment Framework

Before proposing component updates, evaluate:

**Impact Assessment**:
- [ ] How many agents would benefit from this update?
- [ ] How many builders have reported issues this update would address?
- [ ] What evidence exists that current version is problematic?
- [ ] Would update provide measurable improvement in agent effectiveness?

**Compatibility Assessment**:
- [ ] Does update maintain binary decision model principles?
- [ ] Can existing agents continue using current component version?
- [ ] Does update avoid breaking changes to component interface?
- [ ] Will update integrate well with other existing components?

**Quality Assessment**:
- [ ] Does update improve component clarity and usability?
- [ ] Is updated version more complete and actionable?
- [ ] Does update include better examples and usage guidance?
- [ ] Will update reduce need for component customization?

## Types of Component Updates

### 1. Effectiveness Improvements

**Purpose**: Make components produce better agent outcomes

**Common Improvements**:
- **Pattern Refinement**: Better instruction sequences based on usage data
- **Completeness Enhancement**: Adding missing elements that improve outcomes
- **Focus Sharpening**: Clearer targeting for specific agent capabilities
- **Integration Optimization**: Better compatibility with commonly used components

**Example - Planning Component Enhancement**:
```markdown
# Before (Original)
- Use planning tools for complex tasks
- Break work into manageable steps
- Track progress appropriately

# After (Improved)
- ALWAYS use the WorkspacePlanningTools for multi-step work
- Break down complex tasks into small incremental steps (single session completion)
- Use hierarchical task breakdowns where appropriate
- Create tasks with clear deliverables and success criteria
- Mark tasks complete only after verification
```

**Effectiveness Update Process**:
1. **Evidence Collection**: Document specific problems with current version
2. **Pattern Development**: Develop improved approach based on successful agents
3. **A/B Testing**: Test improved version against current version
4. **Impact Measurement**: Quantify improvement in agent effectiveness
5. **Community Validation**: Confirm improvement with multiple builders

### 2. Clarity and Usability Improvements

**Purpose**: Make components easier to understand and implement

**Common Improvements**:
- **Language Simplification**: Clearer, more direct instruction language
- **Structure Enhancement**: Better organization and logical flow
- **Example Improvements**: More practical and relevant usage examples
- **Customization Guidance**: Clearer adaptation instructions

**Example - Workspace Organization Clarity Improvement**:
```markdown
# Before (Unclear)
## Workspace Organization
Use workspace appropriately for file management and organization.

# After (Clear)
## Workspace Organization

### Current Work
- **Workspace**: Use the designated workspace for all work unless otherwise specified
- **Scratchpad**: Use the `.scratch` folder in your workspace for temporary work and agent notes
- **Trash**: Use `workspace_mv` to place outdated or unneeded files in `.scratch/trash`

### File Operations
- Use `workspace_write` with `append` mode for file appending
- Use `workspace_mv` for moving/renaming files
- Always verify file operations completed successfully
```

**Clarity Update Process**:
1. **Issue Identification**: Document specific clarity problems reported
2. **Language Review**: Identify ambiguous or unclear instruction elements
3. **Structure Analysis**: Evaluate component organization and flow
4. **Rewrite and Test**: Create clearer version and test with unfamiliar builders
5. **Feedback Integration**: Refine based on usability testing results

### 3. Focused Variant Creation

**Purpose**: Create targeted versions for different agent focuses without adding complexity

**When to Create Variants**:
- Different agent types need materially different instruction patterns
- Single component serves multiple distinct use cases poorly
- Clear usage criteria exist for selecting between versions
- Variants would eliminate need for extensive customization

**Example - Human Pairing Variant Creation**:
```markdown
# Before (Single Component)
## Human Pairing Component
General instructions that tried to cover both general and development contexts

# After (Focused Variants)
## Human Pairing Component (General Focus)
[Instructions optimized for general-purpose agents]

## Human Pairing Component (Development Focus)
[Instructions optimized for development agents with testing protocols]
```

**Variant Creation Process**:
1. **Usage Analysis**: Identify different usage patterns in current implementations
2. **Need Validation**: Confirm different agent types need different approaches
3. **Variant Design**: Create focused versions for each distinct need
4. **Selection Criteria**: Develop clear criteria for choosing between variants
5. **Migration Guidance**: Provide guidance for moving from general to focused variant

### 4. Integration and Compatibility Updates

**Purpose**: Improve component compatibility and integration with other components

**Common Improvements**:
- **Conflict Resolution**: Address conflicts when components are used together
- **Reference Updates**: Update cross-references as library evolves
- **Interface Standardization**: Align component interfaces for better integration
- **Dependency Clarification**: Clarify relationships with other components

**Integration Update Process**:
1. **Compatibility Testing**: Test component with all other common components
2. **Conflict Identification**: Document any integration issues or conflicts
3. **Interface Review**: Ensure component follows library standards
4. **Resolution Development**: Create solutions that maintain component independence
5. **Integration Validation**: Test solutions across different component combinations
