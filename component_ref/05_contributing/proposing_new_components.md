# Proposing New Components

This guide provides a step-by-step process for identifying, validating, and proposing new component patterns for the Agent Component Reference Library.

## When to Propose a New Component

### Clear Indicators for New Component Needs

**Strong Indicators** (Definitely propose):
- **Repeated Pattern**: You've used the same instruction pattern across 3+ different agents
- **Binary Usage**: Agents either fully implement this pattern or don't use it at all
- **Knowledge Gap**: Current library doesn't address a specific, proven capability
- **Community Need**: Multiple builders report similar missing functionality

**Good Indicators** (Consider proposing):
- **Proven Effectiveness**: Pattern significantly improves agent performance
- **Clear Focus**: Pattern addresses specific, well-defined capability
- **Reuse Potential**: Pattern would benefit from standardization across community
- **Quality Improvement**: Pattern represents better approach than existing practice

### When NOT to Propose New Components

**Don't propose when**:
- ❌ **Overlaps Existing**: Functionality already covered by existing component
- ❌ **Too Specific**: Pattern only applies to one narrow use case
- ❌ **Conditional Logic**: Pattern requires "if/then" decision making within component
- ❌ **Partial Implementation**: Pattern is incomplete or requires other components
- ❌ **Experimental**: Pattern hasn't been proven in multiple real agents

### Component Readiness Assessment

Before proposing, ensure your component idea meets these criteria:

**Pattern Validation**:
- [ ] Pattern used successfully in at least 3 different agents
- [ ] Pattern demonstrates measurable improvement in agent effectiveness
- [ ] Pattern has consistent implementation across different usage contexts
- [ ] Pattern represents stable best practice, not experimental approach

**Binary Decision Clarity**:
- [ ] Clear YES/NO criteria for when to use this component
- [ ] No ambiguous or conditional usage scenarios
- [ ] Complete implementation when selected (no partial usage)
- [ ] Obvious decision point for agent builders

**Component Independence**:
- [ ] Component works standalone without requiring other components
- [ ] Component provides complete functionality for its domain
- [ ] No dependencies on external tools or configurations
- [ ] Can be integrated with any other components without conflicts

**Community Value**:
- [ ] Multiple agent builders would benefit from this component
- [ ] Pattern addresses gap in current library coverage
- [ ] Component would reduce repetitive work across builders
- [ ] Pattern captures valuable institutional knowledge

## Component Identification Process

### 1. Pattern Recognition

**Look for Recurring Patterns**:
- Review your successful agents for repeated instruction blocks
- Identify patterns that appear across different agent types or domains
- Notice instructions that consistently improve agent effectiveness
- Document patterns that other builders have asked about or adopted

**Pattern Analysis Questions**:
- What specific capability does this pattern provide?
- How do agents behave differently with vs. without this pattern?
- Is the implementation consistent across different agents?
- Would this pattern benefit from standardization?

**Documentation Template**:
```markdown
**Pattern Name**: [Descriptive name for the pattern]
**Capability**: [What specific capability this pattern provides]
**Usage Context**: [When/where this pattern is typically used]
**Implementation**: [Core instruction block that implements pattern]
**Evidence**: [List of agents where pattern has been used successfully]
**Benefits**: [How this pattern improves agent effectiveness]
```

### 2. Binary Decision Validation

**Formulate Clear Decision Criteria**:
- Create simple YES/NO question for when to use this component
- Ensure decision criteria are unambiguous and actionable
- Test decision criteria with other builders for clarity
- Validate that agents either fully use the pattern or don't use it at all

**Decision Criteria Template**:
```markdown
**Binary Decision**: Does this agent [specific capability need]?
- **YES** → Use this component
- **NO** → Skip this component

**Decision Examples**:
- Agent Type A: YES because [specific reason]
- Agent Type B: NO because [specific reason]
- Agent Type C: YES because [specific reason]
```

**Validation Testing**:
- Ask other builders to make the YES/NO decision for 5 different agent scenarios
- Confirm all builders reach same decision for same scenarios
- Refine criteria if any ambiguity or disagreement emerges

### 3. Scope Definition

**Define Component Boundaries**:
- Identify what capabilities are included in this component
- Clarify what capabilities are explicitly excluded
- Ensure no overlap with existing components
- Validate that component has single, clear purpose

**Scope Documentation**:
```markdown
**Included Capabilities**:
- [Specific capability 1]
- [Specific capability 2]
- [Specific capability 3]

**Excluded Capabilities**:
- [Related but separate capability 1]
- [Related but separate capability 2]

**Relationship to Existing Components**:
- [How this differs from Component X]
- [Why this doesn't overlap with Component Y]
```

### 4. Effectiveness Validation

**Measure Pattern Impact**:
- Document how agents perform with vs. without this pattern
- Collect feedback from builders who've used this pattern
- Identify specific problems this pattern solves
- Validate that pattern represents best practice

**Evidence Collection**:
```markdown
**Agent Examples Using Pattern**:
- [Agent Name]: [Brief description of successful usage]
- [Agent Name]: [Brief description of successful usage]
- [Agent Name]: [Brief description of successful usage]

**Effectiveness Evidence**:
- [Specific improvement in agent behavior]
- [Problem this pattern consistently solves]
- [Builder feedback on pattern value]

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
- [Alternative approach 1]: [Why pattern is better]
- [Alternative approach 2]: [Why pattern is better]
```
